#BaristaLog

This is an Android app that I am working on that has a timer and logging capabilities. This will allow baristas to keep of log of different settings which will make it easier for them to fine tune their machines and techniques. It has funcionality for several different devices like the Aeropress and Chemex along with espresso shots. I am thinking about adding functionality in for keeping track of bean roasting times, temps and techniques as well.
